### Notice
- Spotify relies on Web Authentication Calls to Connect to the API remotely - you will need to authorize it to use this plugin.
- **You _NEED_ a client secret and client ID to use this plugin!** This app currently hardcodes my personal Client ID and Client Secret to interact with Spotify. If current app usage hits any API limits, naturally you will need to switch out the current Client ID and Secret.
- To use a custom ID/Secret, create a file called security.store in _**yourFlowUserDataDirectory**\Plugins\SpotifyPremium-**ver**\security.store_ with the following format:
```
{"ClientId":"yourClientSecret", "ClientSecret":"yourClientSecret"}
```

- If using roaming, your Flow Userdata Directory is: `%APPDATA%\FlowLauncher`
- If using portable, your Flow Userdata Directory is: `%localappdata%\FlowLauncher\app-<VersionOfYourFlowLauncher>\UserData`
- To generate a Client ID and Secret, navigate to [your Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/), login, and generate your own ID & Key.
- After generating a key pair, under "edit settings", add `http://localhost:4002/callback` as a Redirect URI.

### Info
- This plugin cannot currently search for Podcasts - this is due to a restructure of the Spotify API which enabled support for "FullEpisode", among other things. See the [SpotifyAPI-NET Documentation](https://johnnycrazy.github.io/SpotifyAPI-NET/docs/iplayableitem) for more information.
- The Spotify queue API currently only supports adding single tracks to queues, not albums, even though the player can add albums, etc.
- Set Flow Launcher Maximum Results Shown to 12 or higher for best results.

### Development
- To get started developing:
    - Restore all NuGet dependencies (dotnet restore)
    - Build with `dotnet build`
    - Copy the `Output/Debug/<Plugin>` folder to your FlowLauncher `Userdata\Plugins` folder

### Third-Party Libraries

- [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) : Spotify API wrapper
- [Json.Net](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) : High performance json library

## To Do - Ideas

- Search user content (saved music)
- Configurable default search type
- Add configuration menu
    - Would really like a config menu for people to put their own app ID/Secrets
